# software-engineering-mentorship

Hi!, I'm Fortune Ikechi, a tech enthusiast, writer, student developer and a Biochemistry student of the University of Port-Harcourt, Choba Rivers State. I'm 20 years of age, the first son and child in a family of six including my parents, my fascination with tech started in 2016 when i left secondary school and couldn't get admitted to the university, something that went on for three years, i wanted to do something to keep myself busy, i loved computers and wanted to  join  the likes of Phillip Emeagwali, but i didn't have a computer, so i went back to Alma mater, working as a secretary, i taught myself to use all Microsoft Offices, type fast and with increased accuracy, it was in those moments i found an article about a developer working for google, i also found out the net earnings of web developers, it seemed to me then that it was an escape from the poverty life i was used to while doing what i love. i did a lot of research and started learning about Javascript first, then PHP, i dropped the two, i kept taking up languages and dropping them, until recently i found a course that's a lot streamlined and insightful. 
Part of the early issues and one that i still have is the lack of a mentor, going through social media networks where developers are very much active, i DM'ed a lot of them asking to be mentored, but most have countered with the reply, they are very busy, and this i've come to  find as true. 
I'd love this program to be fully mentored, for me and everyone applying to be able to have someone with whom, we'd find a friend and teacher. 
If it's feasible, i'd love to be recommended by our mentors here  for future job placements so long as we do very well.

Thank you for this opportunity, 

yours sincerely, 
Fortune Ikechi
